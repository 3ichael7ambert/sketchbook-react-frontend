# My Sketchbook React App

This is a drawing app created using Create React App.

## Getting Started

To run the app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

- `npm start`: Runs the app in development mode.
- `npm test`: Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

## Usage

1. Open the app in your browser.
2. Use the navigation buttons to add different elements to the canvas.
3. Toggle drawing mode to draw freehand on the canvas.
4. Save, clear, or export the canvas using the control panel.

## Components

- `App.js`: Main component rendering the Sketchbook.
- `Sketchbook.js`: Component managing the canvas and drawing functionality.
- `ControlPanel.js`: Component providing buttons for various actions.
- Other components like `Navigation.js`, `FlipPage.js`, `PageElement.js`, etc.

## Dependencies

- React
- Fabric.js
- React Spring
- React Router Dom
- Axios (assuming it's used for API calls)

## Customize

Feel free to customize the app based on your requirements. Explore the code and modify components as needed.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
